    "Failure to see a doctor is a serious public health problem. Missed appointments cost the US healthcare system nearly [$ 200 each](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4714455/). Therefore, it should come as no surprise that reducing absenteeism has become a priority in the United States and around the world. [Numerous studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3962267/) have been conducted to identify the most effective means of reducing absenteeism. The first step to solving the problem is to understand why the patient is missing a scheduled appointment.\n",
